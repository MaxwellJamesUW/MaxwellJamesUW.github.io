                <figcaption>A button connects 5V power to the Arduino's pin 2, which will read in whether the button is pressed down. These are also connected to a resistor and then ground. Four LEDs are connected to their own resistors and arduino pins, as well as ground.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>To have 20mA of current, the blue LED would need 85 ohms of resistance. The red, yellow, and green LEDs would need 160 ohms. I decided to use 330 ohms for all of them because it simplifies things, and I'm fine with a bit less current through them.
                    The button also needs a resistor to prevent a short to ground. I chose to use a 10k ohm resistor because it's enough resistance to ensure the circuit doesn't short and the Arduino reads low when the button is not pressed. Since nothing exploded when we used this value for a pull down resistor in class, I figured it was a good resistance.

                The yellow LED turns on while the button is pressed down.
                The red LED turns on while the button is not pressed down.
                The green LED fades on/off with each button press.
                The blue LED starts on and fades to off gradually while 
                    the button is pressed down.
