        <h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
        
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
              For this project, I will build on my MP3 game and add a database to store high scores.
            </p>

            <p>The current MP3 game can be played here:</p>
            <a href="https://maxwelljamesuw.github.io/devToolchainExample/" target="_blank">Hoop Shooter Game</a>

            <h3>Envisioned Interface</h3>
            <img src="sketches.png"/>
            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>The prototype will build on my MP3 game with a Firebase back-end to store user high scores. High scores are displayed at the end of a game. Stretch goal this version: users can input their names on a start screen.</p>
            <h3>Final Version</h3>
            <p>The final version will build on the prototype and add polished start and end screens, an option to restart the game, and better visuals and sound effects. New features such as a moving basket game mode and mobile optimization will be added time permitting.</p>

            <h3>Plan</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Create Firebase database for high scores, and test sending scores to it.</li>
              <li>Display high scores when the player finishes a game</li>
              <li>Add basic start screen where user can input their name and hit 'start'</li>
              <li><b>Milestone 1: Prototype due 3/7</b></li>
              <li>Add polished end and start screens to the app</li>
              <li>Add a button to restart the game</li>
              <li>Add sound effects, better visuals</li>
              <li><b>Milestone 2: Final Version due 3/17</b></li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Unknowns</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>How to restart the game without reloading the window</li>
              <li>Creating different screens and changing between them</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Optimize for mobile</li>
              <li>Options to play different game modes such as moving basket or platformer.</li>
            </ul>
