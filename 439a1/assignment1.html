                <figcaption>Three LED and resistor pairs are connected to ground and a pin on the Arduino. The LEDs are red, yellow, and blue.</figcaption>

                <img src="calc.jpg" width=600>
                <figcaption>To have 20mA of current, the blue LED would need 85 ohms of resistance. The red and yellow LEDs would need 160 ohms. I decided to use 330 ohms for all of them because it simplifies things, and I'm fine with a bit less current and LED brightness.</figcaption>
